# Investigating-Netflix-Movies
This project delves into exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset to uncover trends in movie durations over time. Leveraging Python and its powerful data analysis libraries like pandas, the analysis aims to shed light on the evolving landscape of movie durations in the streaming era.

Initially, the dataset is filtered to exclude TV shows, focusing solely on movies. This refined dataset is then subjected to thorough analysis to identify patterns and trends. By examining movie durations by release year and genre, the project seeks to uncover factors driving the observed changes in movie lengths.

Python's pandas library is instrumental in data manipulation and filtering processes. It enables the extraction of relevant insights by slicing and analyzing the dataset based on various criteria. Matplotlib is utilized for data visualization, allowing for the creation of intuitive scatter plots that visually represent the relationships between movie durations and release years.

Insights gleaned from the analysis provide valuable information for content creators, producers, and streaming platforms in understanding audience preferences and adapting content strategies accordingly. Moreover, the project serves as a learning opportunity for data enthusiasts and aspiring data analysts interested in exploring real-world datasets and deriving meaningful insights.

The code and analysis presented in this repository offer a comprehensive overview of Netflix movie duration trends and can serve as a valuable resource for individuals and organizations interested in understanding the dynamics of the streaming entertainment industry.
